		<h2>Web Security</h2>
		<p>
		In today world Web Security is more inporntant then ever.  A user's computer can acces all kinds of information.  But, it can also give 
		out all kinds of personal information.<br><br>
		“In 2011, the annual cost of identity theft alone was $37 billion dollars."  This is a quote by Gordon M. Snow, the FBIs Assistant 
		Director of Cyber Division.  Statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, Washington, 
		D.C. on th 12 of April 2011.

		Types of Security weeknesses
		<ul>
			<li>Geolocation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Geolocation is a technology that uses data acquired from an individual’s computer or mobile device to identify or describe the user’s 
		actual physical location. With location technology, a user’s experience can be uniquely personalized. However users usually cannot 
		identify who is collecting the data and how it is beening used. Source <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2016/volume-5/geolocationthe-risk-and-benefits-of-a-trending-technology">www.isaca.org</a>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>App Version</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hackers like to use flaws in older version of applications on users who don't have an updated version of that app. Malicious Web sites 
		can choose which version your client runs, the older versions of your software can be called up and used to execute a known 
		vulnerability. Source <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2648376/old-apps--new-vulnerabilities.html">www.infoworld.com</a>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On Line</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Computers that are online are "easier" to get acces to then computers that are not online. If the computer is not online then an 
		attacker has to get physical access to that computer.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>User Agent</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The user agent is used by the server to identify the internet browser connecting to it. Normally contains information about the brower. 
		Sadly Unless your HTTP traffic is encrypted, the user agent string is easily visible. Malware can also be hidden in the header of a 
		webpage. Source <a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/threat-hunting-for-http-user-agents/">www.cybersecurity-insiders.com</a>
